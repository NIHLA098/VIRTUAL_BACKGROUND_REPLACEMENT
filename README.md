Description:

This project implements a Virtual Background Replacement System using OpenCV. The system allows users to replace the background of a webcam or static image with a custom background image. It utilizes image processing techniques to segment the foreground (person) from the background and seamlessly blend the new background image in place of the original one.

Key functionalities include:

Capturing or uploading a static foreground image.

Uploading a custom background image.

Using OpenCV-based masking and segmentation techniques for background removal.

Merging the segmented foreground with the new background to produce the final output.


The project was developed as part of the Naan Mudhalvan Training Program and showcases practical applications of computer vision in real-time image manipulation.
